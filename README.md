# Matrix-Python 3 #

###Below is the guide to use the library:###

Import the module in the main python file and create an object of the class "Matrix".The Library is only for square matrices yet and the basic functions that can be performed on non-square matrices will be added soon. The following project Python 3.x.

**Warning**:The work is in progress.
- - - -

* `addMatrix(Matrix obj)`
>The function add the calling instance of `Matrix` to the `Matrix` instance passed as argument and returns the resultant `Matrix` instance

* `inputMatrix()`
>The Function inputs matrix one row at a time, enter the elements seperated by space.

* `mulMatrix(Matrix obj)`
>The function returns a `Matrix` object which is the multiplied result of the calling object and the object passed as argument.

* `printMatrix()`
>The function displays the matrix on the screen.

* `subMatrix(Matrix obj)`
>The function returns the `Matrix` instance of the subtraction of the calling `Matrix` instance and the `Matrix` passed as argument.

* `transMatrix()`
>The function turns the matrix into its transpose.
